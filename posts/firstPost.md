# My First Website

The day I created, with my very own hands, a website that I can ccess on the World Wide Web was the best day of my life to date. I have done a lot of things but nothing comes close to the feeling of accomplishment & success i felt at that moment.

At the beginning I was scared and nervous. I was biting my nails trying to understand what I was seeing, how to read and comprehend the language that was the code in front of me. Luickly for me I have a very patient teacher who allowed me to ask questions, and I mean alot of them, walking me through as slowly as i needed her to as to retain information. Ultimately she gave me the space to input information on my own thus giving me the opportunity to create by my lonesome. 

My journey learning Front-End development is far from over but im happy to say I feel I'm off to a very good start.
